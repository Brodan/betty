# cpamd
cp + mkdir for simplified command-line usage.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Brodan/cpamd.git
$ ln -s cpamd/cpamd /usr/local/bin/
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cpamd
```

## Usage
Use it exactly like you would a normal `cp` command:

```
$ cpamd source_file target_directory
```
For more info on the `cp` command use `$ man cp`.

## Why?
I got really sick of seeing `No such file or directory` when trying to copy files to directories I thought existed.
